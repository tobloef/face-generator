# Face Generator

Created as a parody of CryptoPunks, this deliberately low-effort project turned out more fun than anticipated.

Go to [/faces/random.png](/faces/random.png) for a random face. Or to a specific file name, like [/faces/tobloef.png](/faces/tobloef.png), for a static one that uses the file name as the seed.

A few examples:
